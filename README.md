What is bad software? A complex system that doesn’t help people that much.
When you are making decisions about software, you should guide yourself by always keeping this in mind: How we can help? You can even prioritize feature requests this way.
if you design a bad system, your software’s lifetime will be short.
Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer. — Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity
Bad developers don’t understand what they are doing, and good developers do. It really is that simple.
The truth is that if other developers who read your code can understand it easily it means that you are doing good.

Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does. — Larry Bossidy
The question is: “How simple do you have to be?”

Here is your answer: Stupid, dumb simple.
All changes require maintenance.
Simplicity and complexity are the two main factors that affect code maintenance. The ease of maintenance of any piece of software is proportional to the simplicity of its individual pieces. The effort of maintenance is proportional to the complexity of the software.
The one rule that you should follow about maintenance is:
It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.
Consistency is a big part of simplicity.
